# The Office Project

## Description

The goal of this project was to understand how language differs and compares between all of the major characters of the tv show, The Office.  I addressed the following questions:
*How do speech patterns differ between characters and through seasons?
*Can sentiment analysis uncover trends and intensities in emotion throughout the show?
*Can we understand how certain characters are connected in any episode?
*Can we glean any insights from online sources like Twitter or IMDB?
